# About the Project
## This is the game that I created by following an online course on JavaScript.<br/>
### This game works in following way :
1. This game randomly generates a number between 1 and 20.
2. Then you have to guess that number.
3. If the guessed number is correct than you win else there displays a message whether the guessed number is greater of lesser than actual number
4. If the guessed Number is incorrect than your score decreases by 1.
